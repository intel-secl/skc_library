experiment to use softhsm to generate a keypair in hsm
- private key never leaves hsm, but use key to:
    - use key for csr
    - use key to self-sign csr

- start a server that can prove client tls connection
- use curl with cert from above and key in hsm for tls connecton to server

NOTE: this requires a newer curl (and libcurl) than on centos 7.5
    - I downloaded, built, and install in test location

See config file for options. Also, setup to use libp11-spy as main pkcs11-modle 
to trace pkcs11 calls. You can see in config how to comment out so it goes right to softhsm
You can change location for must things used in config file.

- edit config and make changes
./setup.sh - to initialize softhsm, create key, csr, and cert
    - create dummy root-cert and cert for server (openssl s_server). 
      These certs (and related key) are not in scope

./startup-server.sh in a different window or in backup. It does output stuff so another window is best
./run-client.sh
